# Expo Camera Async Loading Bug

This repository demonstrates and solves a common, yet subtle bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API.  The issue arises from calling `takePictureAsync` before the camera has fully finished loading, resulting in a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'takePictureAsync')` error.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation.

## Problem:
Asynchronous operations within Expo's Camera API can lead to unexpected behavior. The camera might appear ready, but internally, the loading process may not be fully complete.  Calling `takePictureAsync` prematurely results in the error.

## Solution:
The solution involves using the `onCameraReady` callback provided by Expo's `Camera` component. This callback ensures that `takePictureAsync` is only called after the camera is fully initialized and ready for use.  This approach handles the asynchronous nature of the camera loading process reliably.
