This error occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API and attempting to access the `takePictureAsync` method before the camera has finished loading.  It's subtle because the loading process might seem complete, but there's an asynchronous operation happening behind the scenes that isn't immediately apparent. The error manifests as `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'takePictureAsync')` or a similar error referencing `Camera` being undefined.
